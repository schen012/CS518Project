CS518Project: Web-based Digital Library Search Engine with Chatbot for ETDs
Overview
The CS518Project is a web-based digital library search engine designed for electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). The project aims to provide users with a user-friendly interface to search and explore ETDs indexed by Elasticsearch. Additionally, the system incorporates a chatbot feature that enables users to interactively inquire about the content of specific ETDs.

Features
Search Functionality:

Users can utilize a search box on the landing page to search for ETDs.
The search results are displayed on a Search Result Page (SERP).
Summary Page:

Clicking on an item in the SERP opens a summary page for the selected ETD.
The summary page showcases metadata such as title, authors, year, university, advisor, discipline, and abstract.
Chatbot Integration:

The summary page includes a chatbot window for interactive communication.
The chatbot can provide information and answer questions related to the content of the corresponding ETD.
User-friendly Interface:

The UI is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, enhancing the overall user experience.
Automatic Conversation History Deletion:

When a user leaves the summary page, the conversation history with the chatbot is automatically deleted for privacy and security.
