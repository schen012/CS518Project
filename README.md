# CS518Project
#Overview
The goal of this project is to build a web-based digital library search engine with a chatbot for
electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). The web-based user interface (UI) should have a
landing page containing a text box for users to search for ETDs indexed by Elasticsearch. When
a user clicks one item in the search result page (SERP), a summary page should show up and
display metadata of an ETD, including its title, authors, year, university, advisor, discipline, and
abstract. The summary page also contains a chatbot, which can answer questions on the content
of corresponding ETD on the summary page. The chatbot window may prompt out or imbedded
in the webpage. When the user leaves the summary page, the conversation history is
automatically deleted.
